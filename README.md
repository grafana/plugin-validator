[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/grafana/plugin-validator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/grafana/plugin-validator)

The tool helps speed up the process of publishing plugins to [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/). It runs a series of [analyzers](#analyzers) to ensure plugins are following best practices; checking for security and structural issues, as well as specific requirements related to publishing. A general overview of these requirements can be found here: <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/publishing-and-signing-criteria/>.

It requires a path to a remote or local ZIP archive of the plugin to be specified, for example:

- **Remote**: `https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip`
- **Local**: `file://Users/me/Downloads/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip`

You can **additionally** provide a link to the source code for the project with `-sourceCodeUri` to enable additional analyzers such as the Vulnerability Scan.

## Installation and usage

### Docker (recommended)

It is easiest to run the tool using the Docker image as it contains all the [security scanning tools](#security-tools) needed for the full set of analyzers - so you don't need to have these additional tools installed on your system.

```SHELL
docker run --pull=always grafana/plugin-validator-cli [options] [path/to/plugin_archive.zip]
```

#### Example 1 (basic)

```SHELL
docker run --pull=always grafana/plugin-validator-cli https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip
```

#### Example 2 (specifying source code location)

```SHELL
docker run --pull=always grafana/plugin-validator-cli -sourceCodeUri https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/tree/v2.1.2 https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip
```

### NPX

```SHELL
npx -y @grafana/plugin-validator@latest -sourceCodeUri [options] [path/to/plugin_archive.zip]
```

### Locally

First you must compile and install it:

```SHELL
git clone git@github.com:grafana/plugin-validator.git
cd plugin-validator/pkg/cmd/plugincheck2
go install
```

Then you can run the utility:

```SHELL
plugincheck2 -sourceCodeUri [source_code_location/] [plugin_archive.zip]
```

### Generating Local Files For Validation

You must create a `.zip` archive containing the `dist/` directory but named as your plugin ID.

```SHELL
PLUGIN_ID=$(grep '"id"' < src/plugin.json | sed -E 's/.*"id" *: *"(.*)".*/\1/')
cp -r dist "${PLUGIN_ID}"
zip -qr "${PLUGIN_ID}.zip" "${PLUGIN_ID}"
npx @grafana/plugin-validator@latest -sourceCodeUri file://. "${PLUGIN_ID}.zip"
```

You can optionally remove the files that were generated:

```SHELL
rm -r "${PLUGIN_ID}" "${PLUGIN_ID}.zip"
```

## Options

Additional options can be passed to the tool:

```
❯ plugincheck2 -help
Usage plugincheck2:
  -config string (optional)
        Path to configuration file
  -sourceCodeUri string (optional)
        URI to the source code of the plugin. If set, the source code will be downloaded and analyzed. This can be a ZIP file URL, a URL to git repository or a local file (starting with `file://`)
  -strict (optional)
        If set, plugincheck returns non-zero exit code for warnings

```

### Using a configuration file

You can pass a configuration YAML file to the validator with the `-config` option. Several configuration examples are available to use here <https://github.com/grafana/plugin-validator/tree/main/config>

#### Enabling and disabling analyzers via config

If you wish to disable an specific check (analyzer) you can define this in your [configuration file](#using-a-configuration-file), adding an `analyzers` section and specifying which analyzer or analyzer rules to enable and disable.

E.g.: disable the `version` analyzer

```yaml
global:
  enabled: true
  jsonOutput: false
  reportAll: false

analyzers:
  version:
    enabled: false
```

You can also disable specific rules or change their severity level:

```yaml
global:
  enabled: true
  jsonOutput: false
  reportAll: false

analyzers:
  readme:
    rules:
      missing-readme:
        enabled: true
        severity: warning
```

Severity levels could be: `error`, `warning`, `ok`

> Note: Grafana Labs enforces its own configuration for plugins submissions and your own config file can't change these rules.

### Source code

You can specify the location of the plugin source code to the validator with the `-sourceCodeUri` option. Doing so allows for additional [analyzers](#analyzers) to be run and for a more complete scan.

### Supported remote Git services

The following **public** git services are supported

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

Private repositories are not currently supported.

Make sure to include the ref (branch or tag) of the corresponding source code.

e.g.: You are validating version `v2.1.2` and your project is in github. Make sure you create a corresponding tag or branch and use the url `https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/tree/v2.1.2`

## Debug mode

You can run the validator in debug mode to get more information about the running checks and possible errors.

Docker:

```SHELL
docker run --pull=always -e DEBUG=1 grafana/plugin-validator-cli -sourceCodeUri https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/tree/v2.1.2 https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip
```

NPX:

```SHELL
DEBUG=1 npx -y @grafana/plugin-validator@latest -sourceCodeUri https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/tree/v2.1.2 https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip
```

Locally:

```SHELL
DEBUG=1 plugincheck2 -sourceCodeUri https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/tree/v2.1.2 https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel/releases/download/v2.1.2/grafana-clock-panel-2.1.2.zip
```

## Security tools

This validator makes uses of the following open source security tools:

- [osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)
- [semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep)
- [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)

If you run the validator locally or via NPX you can benefit from installing these tools in your system to make them part of your validation checks.

## Analyzers

The tool runs a series of analyzers to ensure submitted plugins are following best practices, and speed up the process of approving a plugin for publishing, detailed in the table below. The Analyzer column includes the name required for altering the behavior of a given check in a [configuration file](#using-a-configuration-file). The Dependencies column specifies whether the analyzer requires the source code for the plugin to be provided with `sourceCodeUri` or for any additional [security scanning tools](#security-tools) to be present.

## Output

By default, the tool will output results in plain text as shown below.

Default:

```TEXT
warning: README.md: possible broken link: https://www.d3js.org (404 Not Found)
detail: README.md might contain broken links. Check that all links are valid and publicly accessible.
warning: README.md contains developer jargon: (yarn)
detail: Move any developer and contributor documentation to a separate file and link to it from the README.md. For example, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, etc.
error: osv-scanner detected a critical severity issue
detail: SEVERITY: CRITICAL in package immer, vulnerable to CVE-2021-23436
error: osv-scanner detected a critical severity issue
detail: SEVERITY: CRITICAL in package json-schema, vulnerable to CVE-2021-3918
error: Plugin version 0.0.9 is invalid.
detail: The submitted plugin version 0.0.9 is not greater than the latest published version 0.0.9 on grafana.com.
```

This can be changed to JSON by passing a configuration file which includes:

```yaml
global:
  jsonOutput: true
```

Resulting in output similar to:

```JSON

  "id": "briangann-gauge-panel",
  "version": "0.0.9",
  "plugin-validator": {
    "brokenlinks": [
      {
