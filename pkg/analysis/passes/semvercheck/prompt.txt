You will analyze changes in this Grafana plugin to detect breaking changes and verify SemVer compliance. Use `git diff` to see the diff and `git show` to see full files in a specific commit.

Analyze the changes between the versions focusing on:
1. Breaking changes (API changes, removed functionality, behavioral changes that could break existing users)
2. New features (new functionality, new APIs, new options)
3. Bug fixes (corrections to existing functionality)

New version: {{.NewVersion}} introduced in commit: {{.NewCommit}}
Current version: {{.CurrentVersion}} introduced in commit: {{.CurrentCommit}}

Analyze the changes and write your analysis to a JSON file "replies.json" with this format:

{
  "has_breaking_changes": true|false,
  "has_new_features": true|false,
  "has_bug_fixes": true|false,
  "breaking_changes_list": ["description of breaking change 1", "description of breaking change 2"],
  "new_features_list": ["description of new feature 1", "description of new feature 2"],
  "bug_fixes_list": ["description of bug fix 1", "description of bug fix 2"],
  "recommended_version_bump": "major|minor|patch",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this version bump is recommended based on the changes"
}

Use jq to validate replies.json is valid JSON, fix any issues if necessary.

Once you are finished say "I finished the SemVer analysis"
